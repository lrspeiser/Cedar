# Academic Research Initialization

## üéØ Overview

Enhanced the research initialization process to include top academic research sources, a comprehensive background summary, and a single focused research directions question. Users now receive relevant academic sources, research context, and can select multiple research directions from a numbered list.

## üîß Problem Solved

### **Before**: Limited Research Context
- Questions were in restrictive "Would you rather A) or B)" format
- No research sources provided before starting
- No background context for the research
- Limited flexibility in research direction selection
- Users had to choose between only two options per question

### **After**: Academic Research Context
- Top 3 academic research sources provided with summaries
- Comprehensive background summary section for research context
- Single focused question with numbered research directions
- Users can select multiple research directions
- Academic rigor in source selection and presentation

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. **Backend Changes** (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`)

#### **New Data Structures**
```rust
#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct ResearchSource {
    title: String,
    authors: String,
    url: Option<String>,
    summary: String,
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct ResearchInitialization {
    title: String,
    sources: Vec<ResearchSource>,  // NEW: Academic research sources
    background_summary: String,    // NEW: Research background summary
    questions: Vec<ResearchQuestion>,
}
```

#### **Enhanced LLM Prompt**
```rust
let prompt = format!(
    r#"Based on this research goal: "{}"

Generate:
1. A concise title (5 words or less)
2. Top 3 academic research sources on this subject with 1-paragraph summaries
3. A comprehensive background summary section for the research paper
4. One question with numbered research directions to focus on

ACADEMIC SOURCES REQUIREMENT: Find the top 3 most relevant and authoritative ACADEMIC research sources (peer-reviewed papers, academic studies, scholarly articles) on this subject. Prioritize academic sources over industry reports or expert analyses. For each source, provide:
- Title of the academic paper/study
- Authors and their academic affiliations
- URL if available (preferably DOI or academic database links)
- A comprehensive 1-paragraph summary of the key findings, methodology, and relevance to the research goal

BACKGROUND SUMMARY REQUIREMENT: Create a comprehensive background summary section (2-3 paragraphs) that synthesizes the key findings from the academic sources and provides context for the research. This should include:
- Current state of knowledge on the topic
- Key findings from recent academic research
- Gaps in current understanding
- Relevance to the research goal
- Context for why this research is important

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS QUESTION: Provide ONE question with a numbered list of possible research directions and ask the user to select which ones to include. For example:
"Here are some research directions we could explore:
1. Statistical analysis with detailed charts and graphs
2. Machine learning model to predict future trends
3. Historical data pattern analysis
4. Real-time data insights
5. Comparative analysis across different time periods
6. Literature review and meta-analysis
7. Experimental design and hypothesis testing
8. Qualitative analysis and case studies

Which of these research directions would you like us to include in our analysis? (You can select multiple numbers like '1, 3, 5, 7' or just one like '2')"
"#,
    request.goal
);
```

#### **Enhanced Response Parsing**
```rust
// Parse background summary
let background_summary = response_json["background_summary"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string();

// Parse sources
let sources: Vec<ResearchSource> = sources_array
    .iter()
    .map(|s| ResearchSource {
        title: s["title"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        authors: s["authors"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        url: s["url"].as_str().map(|u| u.to_string()),
        summary: s["summary"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
    })
    .collect();

// Parse questions
let questions: Vec<ResearchQuestion> = questions_array
    .iter()
    .map(|q| ResearchQuestion {
        id: q["id"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        question: q["question"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        category: q["category"].as_str().unwrap_or("general").to_string(),
        required: q["required"].as_bool().unwrap_or(false),
    })
    .collect();
```

### 2. **Frontend Changes** (`frontend/src/components/ResearchInitialization.tsx`)

#### **Enhanced Data Structures**
```typescript
interface ResearchSource {
  title: string;
  authors: string;
  url?: string;
  summary: string;
}

interface ResearchInitialization {
  title: string;
  sources: ResearchSource[];  // NEW: Academic research sources
  background_summary: string; // NEW: Research background summary
  questions: ResearchQuestion[];
}
```
