# Enhanced Research Initialization

## üéØ Overview

Enhanced the research initialization process to include top research sources and improved question format. Users now receive relevant research sources before answering questions, and questions use a more flexible numbered format instead of restrictive A/B choices.

## üîß Problem Solved

### **Before**: Limited Research Context
- Questions were in restrictive "Would you rather A) or B)" format
- No research sources provided before starting
- Limited flexibility in research direction selection
- Users had to choose between only two options per question

### **After**: Rich Research Context
- Top 3 research sources provided with summaries
- Questions use numbered lists for multiple selections
- Users can select multiple research directions
- Better context for informed decision-making

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. **Backend Changes** (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`)

#### **New Data Structures**
```rust
#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct ResearchSource {
    title: String,
    authors: String,
    url: Option<String>,
    summary: String,
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct ResearchInitialization {
    title: String,
    sources: Vec<ResearchSource>,  // NEW: Research sources
    questions: Vec<ResearchQuestion>,
}
```

#### **Enhanced LLM Prompt**
```rust
let prompt = format!(
    r#"Based on this research goal: "{}"

Generate:
1. A concise title (5 words or less)
2. Top 3 research sources on this subject with 1-paragraph summaries
3. Exactly 3 specific questions to help clarify the research approach and preferences

RESEARCH SOURCES REQUIREMENT: Find the top 3 most relevant and authoritative research sources (academic papers, industry reports, expert analyses) on this subject. For each source, provide:
- Title of the research/paper/report
- Authors or organization
- URL if available
- A comprehensive 1-paragraph summary of the key findings and relevance

QUESTION FORMAT REQUIREMENT: Instead of A) or B) format, provide a numbered list of research directions and ask the user to select which numbers they want to focus on. For example:
"Here are some research directions we could explore:
1. Statistical analysis with detailed charts and graphs
2. Machine learning model to predict future trends
3. Historical data pattern analysis
4. Real-time data insights
5. Comparative analysis across different time periods

Which of these research directions would you like us to focus on? (You can select multiple numbers like '1, 3, 5' or just one like '2')"
"#,
    request.goal
);
```

#### **Enhanced Response Parsing**
```rust
// Parse sources
let sources: Vec<ResearchSource> = sources_array
    .iter()
    .map(|s| ResearchSource {
        title: s["title"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        authors: s["authors"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        url: s["url"].as_str().map(|u| u.to_string()),
        summary: s["summary"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
    })
    .collect();

// Parse questions
let questions: Vec<ResearchQuestion> = questions_array
    .iter()
    .map(|q| ResearchQuestion {
        id: q["id"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        question: q["question"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string(),
        category: q["category"].as_str().unwrap_or("general").to_string(),
        required: q["required"].as_bool().unwrap_or(false),
    })
    .collect();
```

### 2. **Frontend Changes** (`frontend/src/components/ResearchInitialization.tsx`)

#### **Enhanced Data Structures**
```typescript
interface ResearchSource {
  title: string;
  authors: string;
  url?: string;
  summary: string;
}

interface ResearchInitialization {
  title: string;
  sources: ResearchSource[];  // NEW: Research sources
  questions: ResearchQuestion[];
}
```

#### **Research Sources Display**
```typescript
