# Research Plan Generation and Execution System

## üéØ Overview

The Research Plan Generation and Execution System provides a comprehensive workflow for creating, managing, and executing research plans with step-by-step guidance. Users can generate research plans based on their goals and answers, execute individual steps with "Go" buttons, and receive automatically generated next steps based on execution results.

## üîß Problem Solved

### **Before**: Limited Research Execution
- Research was executed automatically without user control
- No visibility into individual steps or their results
- No ability to pause, review, or modify execution
- Limited feedback and progress tracking
- No dynamic next steps generation

### **After**: Interactive Research Execution
- Research plans with structured, executable steps
- Manual step execution with "Go" buttons
- Real-time results display with logs and output
- Automatic next steps generation based on results
- Full control over research execution flow
- Professional research workflow experience

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### **Backend (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`)**

#### **New Data Structures**
```rust
#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct ResearchPlanStep {
    id: String,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    code: Option<String>,
    status: String, // "pending", "ready", "executing", "completed", "failed"
    order: usize,
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct ResearchPlan {
    id: String,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    steps: Vec<ResearchPlanStep>,
    created_at: String,
    status: String, // "draft", "ready", "executing", "completed"
}
```

#### **New Commands**
- **`generate_research_plan`**: Creates comprehensive research plans based on goal, answers, sources, and background
- **`execute_step`**: Executes individual research steps with code execution and result tracking
- **`generate_next_steps`**: Analyzes completed steps and generates new steps based on results

#### **Research Plan Generation**
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn generate_research_plan(
    request: GenerateResearchPlanRequest,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
) -> Result<ResearchPlan, String> {
    // LLM prompt to generate structured research plan
    // Returns plan with steps, code, and execution details
}
```

#### **Step Execution**
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn execute_step(
    request: ExecuteStepRequest,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
) -> Result<serde_json::Value, String> {
    // Execute Python code with logging
    // Extract variables and detect libraries
    // Return comprehensive execution results
}
```

#### **Next Steps Generation**
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn generate_next_steps(
    request: GenerateNextStepsRequest,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
) -> Result<serde_json::Value, String> {
    // Analyze completed steps and results
    // Generate new steps based on progress
    // Return actionable next steps
}
```

### **Frontend (`frontend/src/components/`)**

#### **ResearchPlanComponent**
- Displays research plans with step-by-step interface
- "Go" buttons for manual step execution
- Real-time status tracking and result display
- Automatic next steps generation when all steps complete

#### **ResearchSession Integration**
- Triggers research plan generation after questions are answered
- Displays research plan toggle and component
- Handles step completion and next steps generation
- Integrates with existing notebook interface

#### **API Service Updates**
```typescript
// New API methods
async generateResearchPlan(request: { 
  goal: string; 
  answers: Record<string, string>; 
  sources: any[]; 
  background_summary: string; 
}): Promise<ResearchPlan>

async executeStep(request: { 
  sessionId: string; 
  projectId: string; 
  stepId: string; 
  code: string; 
  stepTitle: string; 
  stepDescription: string; 
}): Promise<any>

async generateNextSteps(request: { 
  goal: string; 
  completedSteps: any[]; 
  currentResults: any; 
  projectContext: any; 
}): Promise<ResearchPlanStep[]>
```

## üîÑ Research Workflow

### **1. Research Initialization**
```
User enters research goal
‚Üì
LLM generates academic sources and background summary
‚Üì
User answers research direction questions
‚Üì
System stores initialization data
```

### **2. Research Plan Generation**
```
System triggers plan generation with:
- Research goal
- User answers
- Academic sources
- Background summary
‚Üì
LLM generates structured research plan with:
- Plan title and description
- Numbered steps with titles and descriptions
- Python code for each step
- Execution order and status
```

### **3. Plan Display and Execution**
```
Research plan displayed with:
- Plan header with title and description
- Step-by-step list with "Go" buttons
- Status indicators (pending, executing, completed, failed)
- Step descriptions and code preview
‚Üì
User clicks "Go" button on any step
‚Üì
System executes step and displays results
```

### **4. Results and Next Steps**
```
Step execution returns:
- Execution status (success/failure)
- Output and logs
- Data summaries
- Execution time
- Variable extraction
- Library detection
‚Üì
Results displayed in notebook cells
‚Üì
When all steps complete, system generates next steps
‚Üì
New plan created with next steps for continued research
```
